### Deployment Guidelines
1. **Web Hosting**: Ultimate Dashboard can be served directly as static HTML
2. **CDN**: All external resources use CDN links for fast delivery
3. **Compression**: Enable gzip compression on web server
4. **Caching**: Set appropriate cache headers for static resources

## Testing Artifacts

Created during testing:
- `test-dashboard-final.html` - Ultimate Dashboard output
- `test-enhanced.html` - Enhanced Dashboard output
- `analyze_dashboards.py` - Comparison analysis script
- `dashboard_test.html` - Interactive testing page
- `test_dashboards.py` - Initial test script (requires BeautifulSoup)

## Conclusion

The **Ultimate Dashboard** is production-ready and provides the best balance of features, performance, and usability. It should be the primary dashboard generator for CPPCheck Studio.

The Enhanced Dashboard, while offering some unique features like code contexts, requires significant optimization before it can be considered for production use due to its excessive file size and performance issues.
