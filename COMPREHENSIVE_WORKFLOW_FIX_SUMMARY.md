# Comprehensive GitHub Actions Workflow Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The workflows were using `type: number` for workflow_dispatch inputs, which is **not officially supported** by GitHub Actions. The only valid input types for workflow_dispatch are:
- `string` (default)
- `boolean`
- `choice`
- `environment`

## Fix Applied

Changed all `type: number` occurrences to `type: string` in the following workflows:
1. `analyze-cpp-repo.yml` - max_files input
2. `analyze-lpzrobots.yml` - clone_depth and max_issues inputs  
3. `analyze-on-demand-v2.yml` - max_files input
4. `analyze-on-demand.yml` - max_files input
5. `analyze-showcase.yml` - max_files input

## Implementation Details

### Before:
```yaml
max_files:
  description: 'Maximum files to analyze'
  required: false
  type: number
  default: 100
```

### After:
```yaml
max_files:
  description: 'Maximum files to analyze'
  required: false
  type: string
  default: '100'
```

## Handling String-to-Number Conversion

The workflows already have proper handling for converting string inputs to numbers:

1. **analyze-on-demand.yml** and **analyze-on-demand-v2.yml**:
   ```bash
   # Convert string to integer, removing decimal part if present
   MAX_FILES=$(echo "${{ env.MAX_FILES }}" | cut -d. -f1)
   
   # Additional validation
   if \! [[ "$MAX_FILES" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
     MAX_FILES=500
   fi
   ```

2. **Direct usage in find commands**:
   ```bash
   find ... | head -n ${{ github.event.inputs.max_files }} > cpp_files.txt
   ```
   This works because `head -n` accepts string arguments that look like numbers.

## Testing the Fix

To test these changes:

1. Go to the Actions tab in your repository
2. Select any of the modified workflows
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter numeric values in the input fields (they will be treated as strings)
5. The workflow should execute successfully

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Compliance**: Workflows now use only officially supported input types
2. **Reliability**: Eliminates potential issues with workflow dispatch
3. **Compatibility**: Works across all GitHub Actions environments
4. **Validation**: Existing number validation code ensures proper handling

## No Breaking Changes

The fix maintains backward compatibility because:
- Shell commands naturally handle numeric strings
- Validation code already converts strings to integers
- Default values are now quoted strings but behave identically

## Cleanup

The Python script `fix_workflow_number_types.py` can be safely deleted after this fix is committed, as it's no longer needed.

## Commit Message Suggestion

```
