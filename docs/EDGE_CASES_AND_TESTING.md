# Edge Cases and Testing Considerations

## 🧪 Test Scenarios to Verify

### 1. **Progress Monitoring Edge Cases**

#### Scenario: No errors found
- XML file will be very small
- Monitor might show 0% progress
- **Mitigation**: Monitor XML file size growth, not just error count

#### Scenario: Very fast analysis (<10 seconds)
- Monitor might not update in time
- **Mitigation**: Initial status shows "Analyzing..." immediately

#### Scenario: Very large codebase (10,000+ files)
- Conservative 50% estimate might be too low
- **Mitigation**: Capped at 95% to never show false completion

### 2. **Gallery Display Edge Cases**

#### Scenario: Partial analysis failure
- Some files analyzed, then error
- **Expected**: Shows issues found before failure

#### Scenario: Empty repository (no C++ files)
- Analysis completes with 0 files
- **Expected**: Gallery shows 0 files, 0 issues correctly

#### Scenario: Network issues during status push
- Status updates might fail
- **Mitigation**: Background process continues, no workflow failure

### 3. **Concurrency Issues**

#### Scenario: Multiple analyses running
- Status files might conflict
- **Mitigation**: Each analysis has unique ID

#### Scenario: Workflow cancelled mid-analysis
- Background processes might continue
- **Mitigation**: Stop signal files, timeout mechanisms

## 🔍 Manual Testing Commands

```bash
# Test progress monitor locally
export ANALYSIS_ID="test-123"
export REPO="test/repo"
export FILE_COUNT="100"
./scripts/monitor-cppcheck-progress.sh test.log test.pid &

# Test issue breakdown
export ISSUE_COUNT="1048"
python3 scripts/extract-issue-breakdown.py nonexistent.json
# Should output estimated breakdown

# Test gallery with mock data
# Create test JSON with issues_found but empty issues object
```

## 📋 Verification Steps

1. **Run analysis on small repo** (< 10 files)
   - Verify progress shows quickly
   - Check gallery shows correct counts

2. **Run analysis on medium repo** (100-500 files)
   - Monitor progress updates
   - Verify ETA calculations
   - Check final gallery entry

3. **Simulate failure scenarios**
   - Kill workflow mid-analysis
   - Provide invalid JSON
   - Network timeout during push

4. **Check data consistency**
   - Gallery breakdown sums to total
   - Progress never exceeds 100%
   - Status JSON is valid

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Progress Accuracy**: Without `--report-progress`, we estimate based on XML growth
2. **ETA Precision**: Based on linear extrapolation, may vary with file complexity
3. **Parallel Updates**: Multiple status pushes might conflict (handled by git)

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- ✅ No workflow failures due to monitoring
- ✅ Gallery always shows reasonable data
- ✅ Progress provides useful feedback
- ✅ System degrades gracefully
- ✅ Original functionality preserved
