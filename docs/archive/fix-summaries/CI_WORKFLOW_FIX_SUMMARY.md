# CI Workflow Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The GitHub Actions workflow failed with a YAML syntax error on line 269 in `.github/workflows/analyze-on-demand.yml`.

## Root Cause
The failure was caused by improper quoting of multi-line Python scripts in the YAML file. In YAML, multi-line strings containing quotes need to be properly escaped.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Python Script at Line 268-279
**Before:**
```yaml
ISSUE_COUNT=$(python3 -c "
import json
...
" || echo "0")
```

**After:**
```yaml
ISSUE_COUNT=$(python3 -c '
import json
...
' || echo "0")
```

Changed double quotes to single quotes for the outer Python script delimiter and converted inner quotes from single to double.

### 2. Fixed Python Script at Line 305-313
**Before:**
```yaml
python3 -c "
import json
with open('../analysis.json', 'r') as f:
...
" || echo "Could not list files"
```

**After:**
```yaml
python3 -c '
import json
with open("../analysis.json", "r") as f:
...
' || echo "Could not list files"
```

## Why This Happened
The latest commit (f985635) added new Python scripts for progress tracking and issue counting. These scripts used inconsistent quote styles that broke YAML parsing.

## Prevention Tips
1. Always use single quotes for the outer Python `-c` command delimiter in YAML
2. Use double quotes inside the Python script
3. Test workflow changes locally using `yamllint` before committing
4. Consider using YAML multi-line string literals (|, >, |-, >-) for complex scripts

## Additional Notes
While fixing the critical syntax error, I noticed other YAML style issues (trailing spaces, line length) that don't break the workflow but should be cleaned up for better maintainability.

## Testing
After this fix, the workflow should:
1. Parse correctly without YAML syntax errors
2. Execute the Python scripts for issue counting
3. Generate progress updates as intended
